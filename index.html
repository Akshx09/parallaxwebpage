            The theoretical minimal sampling rate at which a finite bandwidth signal can be sampled to retain all information and reconstructed from its sample without any distortion is called the Nyquist sampling rate (fn). The other term for the Nyquist rate is the minimum sampling rate. That means when the sampling rate becomes exactly equal to 2fm samples per second then is called as Nyquist sampling rate. For a bandwidth of span C, the Nyquist frequency is just 2C.

The significance of the Nyquist rate is that it helps to avoid the aliasing problem which is the overlapping of two signals.

            The maximum sampling interval is called the Nyquist interval. That means the rate of sampling is equal to the Nyquist rate, then the time interval between any two adjacent samples is represented as the Nyquist interval. The Nyquist interval can be represented by,
